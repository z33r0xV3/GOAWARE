	it, so the guard itself is nil and calling it throws -- on the first slider in the profile,
	and there are dozens. The old GUI never used the function.

	And even on a current client, a profile that predates a slider (or was written by the old
	GUI, which stored these differently) hands over nil. math.isfinite(nil) does not return

		THIRD time and copied it into the client content directory to get a content id back. 75
		icons during construction, all of it on the critical path before the menu could appear,
		and the first run paid a 105-file download on top.

		The uploaded ids were already sitting right there -- they were the mobile branch, and the
		fallback for every way the disk path could fail -- so both branches had always been
		drawing the same pictures. The disk copy bought nothing. Roblox caches by asset id across
		games and sessions, which a per-install content directory never did, so the ids are also
		warm on the second launch in a way the files were not.

		That also retires the 'ContentId formatting failed' crash at the source rather than
		guarding it: a truncated PNG on disk was what produced an invalid content id, and
		assigning one to .Image throws AT THE ASSIGNMENT, outside every pcall in this file,
		taking the whole GUI down over a single icon. Nothing reads those files now.

		The fallback below is not for the shipped GUI. A handful of paths that only game modules
		ask for (arrowmodule, radaricon, textguiicon, blockedicon, blockedtab) exist in the repo
		but have no uploaded id, so they still resolve the old way -- lazily, the first time a
		module that draws one is built, never during GUI construction. If those ever get uploaded
		and added to the table above, this whole tail can go.

		getcustomasset itself has to stay reachable regardless: games/*.lua hand it USER files
		(custom music, custom textures) through `assetfunction`, and those have no uploaded id and
		no substitute. What is gone is every use of it on the load path.

				Deferred rather than spawned while a profile is being applied.

				task.spawn runs its function INLINE, on the calling thread, until that function
				first yields. So during an apply, module:Load switching a module on ran the whole
				front of that module's setup -- its connections, its ESP objects, its walk of the
				entity list -- synchronously inside the apply loop, before Load's next line.

				Sixty modules in, that is one unbroken block of work, and yieldBuild cannot break
				it up: the budget is only checked BETWEEN modules, never inside the one that is
				currently running. So the apply looked like it was yielding while in fact it was
				executing every enabled module nose to tail without ever reaching a yield.

				queueStart hands them to a drain thread that yields between one module and the
				next, so the apply loop keeps its own yields AND the startups are spread out
				rather than arriving in one block. See queueStart for why deferring alone is not
				enough.

				Only while applying, and only for enable. Uninject tears modules down by toggling
				them off and then destroys the GUI and empties the vape table, so a deferred
				disable would run against a table loopClean has already cleared.

			per keystroke, so holding a key down or pasting a word queued a full rebuild for

			The result only depends on the box's final text, so a burst of keystrokes inside
